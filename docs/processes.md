# Operations and processes

This document describes procedures that are part of normal operations, such as maintenance and upgrades.

*Note:* The processes will initially be manual, but this is expected to change as the platform matures.

Initially, all actions and communications will be manual.
This means that Elastisys will let you know when there are upgrades available or when maintenance is required.
We can then agree on a time for this task if it is not urgent.
Elastisys will also inform users if there are any necessary steps to take before or after an upgrade.
This may include changing API versions for Kubernetes objects or custom resources, for example.
