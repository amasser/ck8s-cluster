    # TODO: Ideally we would only have to render the kubeadm init config in the
    #       initialize-master playbook. However, to allow for any master to run
    #       kubeadm init phase upload-certs we currently render the init config
    #       on all masters instead.
    #       Another way to solve this would be to set the cert encryption key
    #       ourselves.
